# ![alt Logo](https://github.com/decadenza/chordsautoscroll/raw/master/media/icon.png) Chords Autoscroll 
Lyrics and chords auto scroller for musicians, guitar players, etc...

I was looking both to practice with the `tkinter` library to build simple lightweight interfaces and for a guitar chord autoscroller. So here's the result.
It's very basic and it could be improved a lot, nevertheless I wanted to share it.

This simple application solves the annoying scrolling problem when you sing or play reading lyrics or chords on your pc.
You just need to open your file and click "Play". You can adjust speed and text size as you need and the setting will be saved for the next time too.
The GUI also allows simple editing tasks.

**NO REQUIREMENTS**:

Works with Python 3 with standard libraries

Tested with *Python 3.4.2* and *Python 3.8.5*

**USAGE**:

Simply copy all the files in a folder and start ChordsAutoscroll.py with Python 3 interpreter. Via command line:
```
python3 ChordsAutoscroll.py
```

**FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**:

I would appreciate help for the followings:
- [ ] Update recent opened file list at runtime
- [ ] Save settings for each file
- [ ] Dark mode (black background)
- [ ] Solve text encoding issues with some files
- [ ] Package as application easy to install

Cheers!
